# Product Card List

This is my entry for FullStack test for MPC technical assessment test - frontend part. The website is built using Vite, React and Typescript and displays several product cards with price and a Add To Cart / Out Of Stock buttons.

The layout for the card list was designed to be a clear list of the products. Since there are no other elements, they take the majority of the space and were designed to clearly stand out from the background both by using a slight drop shadow, as well as using distinct colors for the buttons, and a clear white background on top of grey-blue gradient. The Cards themselves have an image section taking most (2/3) of the space to attract attention, and a smaller (1/3) details section which communicates the price and availability clearly.

The responsiveness of the site is achieved by using sensible units of width, such as viewport width (vw) for the list itself and rem for most other lengths. Because of this the list adapts well to smaller screen sizes and browser windows.
